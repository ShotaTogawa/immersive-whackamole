# Checkpoint 7

We're almost there! Just 2 more checkpoints. Hang in there!

Here are the goals for this checkpoint:

* [x] In the App component, when a game ends (timer runs out), be sure to update the high score if necessary.
* [x] Be able to play multiple games (clicking “start game” will reset the data and start a new round)
  *  [x] This should also reset the score
* [x] Add a `gameActive` data property to App, and toggle it everytime a game starts or stops.
* [x] Pass down the `gameActive` data property to Moles, and dynamically add the “game-active” class based on the prop to the `moles-container`. (This will toggle the opacity, to signal to the users that the game has started or stopped.)
